## Project Name: 
Exploratory Data Analysis on Synthetic Dataset <br>

## Objective: 
Conduct EDA on a synthetic dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights, preparing the data for further analysis or modeling tasks.

## Key Activities:

### Create or Load Dataset:  <br>
Generated a synthetic dataset containing information on names, ages, salaries, departments, experience, and gender. <br>
### Explore the Dataset: <br>
Displayed the first few rows and summary statistics of the dataset. <br>
Identified missing values and outliers. <br>
Visualized data distributions using histograms and box plots. <br>
### Visualize Relationships: <br>
Created pair plots and correlation heatmaps to analyze relationships between variables. <br>
Used bar plots and pie charts to visualize categorical data distributions. <br>
### Prepare Data for Further Analysis: <br>
Handled missing values and outliers appropriately. <br>
Encoded categorical variables if necessary. <br>

## Technologies Used:
Python: The programming language used. <br>
pandas: For data manipulation and handling. <br>
numpy: For numerical operations. <br>
matplotlib: For creating visualizations and plots. <br>
seaborn: For advanced data visualization (pair plots, heatmaps).
